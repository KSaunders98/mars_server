# Building
- Download the required datasets from [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/Viking/MDIM21/Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m) and [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/Topography/HRSC_MOLA_Blend/Mars_HRSC_MOLA_BlendDEM_Global_200mp) into the datasets directory in this project. Do not rename them.
- Create a file ".env" in the project root with the contents `DATABASE_URL=<your database url here>`.
- Ensure mysql client development package is installed on your machine (`sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev` on Ubuntu)
- Run `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features "mysql"`
    - NOTE: If the mysqlclient shared library isn't in your system path (likely if you're using Windows), you will need to create an environment variable called `MYSQLCLIENT_LIB_DIR` that points to the directory where it is installed for this command to succeed.
- Run `diesel setup` to create the database and schema.
- Ensure GDAL development libraries are installed on your machine (See [here](https://mothergeo-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/how-to/gdal-ubuntu-pkg.html) for details on how to install them on Ubuntu).
- Create an environment variable called `GDAL_LIB_DIR` that points to the directory where libgdal.so is located.
    - NOTE: This environment variable only needs to be present for the first `cargo build` or `cargo run`, then it is no longer necessary (unless you run `cargo clean`).
- Run `cargo build --release` to download and compile the rest of the dependencies and build the programs.
    - NOTE: On Ubuntu you can combine this step with the last one like so: `GDAL_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/ cargo build --release`.
- Run `cargo run --release -p init` to run the program that builds the database. Depending on your storage medium, this may take a while.
- Run `cargo run --release` to run the server program on 127.0.0.1:3000. At this point, the visualization prorgam can be run. Press ctrl+c to stop the server.
